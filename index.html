        relaxation. However, Oggy's tranquility is frequently disrupted by the

        resourceful when it comes to tormenting Oggy. Their interactions with
        Oggy often involve elaborate pranks, traps, and clever strategies to
        outwit the feline. Despite their diminutive size, the cockroaches prove
        to be formidable opponents in their quest to annoy Oggy.
